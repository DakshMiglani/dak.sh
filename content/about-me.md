Hello, My name is Daksh Miglani. I'm an Indian _maker of software_, living in Delhi with a passion for technology and business.

I am building [Kratos](https://kratos.ai), An _A.I. based platform for business tools_.

### My life

I've spent almost my whole life (I'm 17, so yeah.) programming and building startups. My life basically revolves around these:

 - Music
 - Code
 - Startups and Businesses
 - Learning about new Science Stuff
 - Advising and Helping Others
 
I've learnt almost everything by _hitting the roadblocks and removing them_ (trial-and-error), that's one of the reasons why I love to share what I've learnt and help others as well. Please feel free to [email me](mailto:hello@dak.sh), incase you need help or need advise.
