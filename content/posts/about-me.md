Hello, My name is Daksh Miglani. I'm an Indian _maker of software_, living in Delhi with a passion for technology and business.

I work at [Adler](https://adler.ai), Where we provide _AI Modules / Solutions for Enterprises_. Our most notable clients include _KPMG, Duff & Phelps, Bank of Karnataka_.

### My life

I've been writing code since I was 9 years old and I've spent almost my entire life (I'm 18, so yeah!) building startups.

I've learnt almost everything by _hitting the roadblocks and removing them_ (trial-and-error) or you may say failing first and then improving on my failures, that's one of the reasons why I love sharing what I've learnt and advising others!

I've lived a different life, while my old mates are following the same old common road, I'm trying to follow a road not taken. While taking such a trajectory, which not many people support. I'm really thankful to my dad who understands my passion and helps me through the struggles.

I also have a very supportive and a very caring lover, who even after knowing that I was at the blink of failure stayed with me, and helped me a lot through the daily bullets and challenges I faced!

As well as thanks to my good old classmate, who still struck with me and helped me a lot during the times of trouble.

I have notable experience in:

- Building Scalable Systems and Microservices
- Databases (Especially Replication and Transactions)
- Building and Serving Deep Learning Models for Production
- Building Containerised Applications
- Building a CI / CD First Development Environment
- Managing Linux Servers
- Serverless / Cloud Functions
- API Gateways

My Current Interests are:

- Quantum Computing
- Flipping Real Estate and other comodities.
- Algorithmic Trading
- Cryptography
